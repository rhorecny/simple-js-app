This project was created by Ryan Horecny.

This project utilizes an API to load pokemon to a pokedex giving information about all the pokemon. It currently has a load more feature that allows users to see more than the 20 cards that are shown on default.

The original code utilized hard coded pokemon which was time consuming and limiting. The choice to incorporate an API allowed for less code and can utilize future updates without changing code.

In the future, this app would run better if a search function was implimented to allow users to search for a specific pokemon rather than going through the list of cards.

This project taught me the importance of IIFE with outside sources, the use of APIs and how to limit and offset pages to display certain data, but not all data.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ESLint, and Prettier.
